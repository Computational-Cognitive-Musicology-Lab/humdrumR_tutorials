# Data

We've included three datasets in the repo here, all encoded in [humdrum](humdrum.org) format:

+ The 370 four-voice bach chorales, in the `Bach370` directory.
  + The original data can be accessed on [KernScores](https://kern.humdrum.org/cgi-bin/ksbrowse?l=371chorales).
+ The subset of the [CoCoPops](https://github.com/Computational-Cognitive-Musicology-Lab/CoCoPops) dataset that includes melodic transcriptions, in the `CoCoPops` directory.
  + 200 melodic transcriptions from David Temperley and Trevor de Clercq's *RS200* dataset.
  + 214 transcriptions of pieces in McGill's *Billboard* dataset (Burgoyne, et al.).
    + Because there is some overlap between the two sets, there are actually only 409 transcriptions included here.
+ A small subset of the [Saraga](https://mtg.github.io/saraga/) dataset of Indian classical performances, created by the Music Technology Group at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, in the `Saraga` directory.
  + I quickly converted this very raw data to a trivial humdrum format.
