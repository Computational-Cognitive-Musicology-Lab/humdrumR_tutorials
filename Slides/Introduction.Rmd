# Computational Musicology 

+ i.e.,
  + "systematic musicology"
  + "music informatics"
  + "digital humanities"  
  + "corpus study"


## Computational Musicology | What?

Working with "digital scores"---

+ *symbolic* data.
+ representing musical semantics.


## Computational Musicology | Why?

+ Preservation and distribution (history and heritage)
+ Visualization and engraving (composition and arranging)
+ Search (finding music, recommendation)
+ Engineering (compositional tools)
+ Research (theory/analysis, sociology/psychology)

## Computational Musicology | How?

+ Data
  + Encoding and formatting
  + Collection/creation and curation
+ Analysis
  + Writing code!
  



# Humdrum


----


Humdrum is a system for computational musicology created by David Huron, circa 1989--1995.

+ The humdrum ecosystem includes:
  + A data format
    + The "*humdrum syntax*"
  + Software
    + The original *humdrum toolkit* 
    + Craig Sapp's *Verovio Humdrum Viewer*
    + My humdrum$_{\mathbb{R}}$



## The Humdrum Syntax


The humdrum "syntax" is a simple tabular format, emphasizing transparency (read/write ease) and musicological flexibility.

+ Many aspects of music can be encoding in humdrum.
  + Notes and chords.
  + Analytical annotations.
  + Metadata.
  + etc.

## The Humdrum Syntax | **kern

The standard humdrum representation for conventional notation is called `**kern`.

+ Tens of thousands of `**kern` scores are available.
  

---


```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, results = 'asis'}
txt <- readLines('M179.txt')

# txt <- paste0('!!!filter:%20extract%20-s%201-4,0%0A', txt)

str <- tags$div(class = 'notes', tags$iframe(src = paste0('https://verovio.humdrum.org/?k=E&t=', txt), width = '1600px', height = '2000px', title="Verovio Humdrum Viewer"))
str
```


## The Humdrum Syntax | Beyond **kern

Humdrum is flexible and extensible, making it possible to invent new representations for *any* arbitrary information:

+ fingerings
+ phrasing annotations
+ associated dance steps
+ etc.


## The Humdrum Syntax | Beyond the Cannon

Humdrum can also be adapted for pop or folk, from any musical culture.

+ Datasets exist for...
  + Rock/pop music
  + Hip hop
  + Hindustani music
  + Ojibway and Pawnee song
  + Japanese folk songs
  + European folk music



# humdrumR


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/humdrumR.svg')
```


## Humdrum + R

Humdrum$_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a new, R-based, software for analyzing humdrum data.

![](images/humdrumR_light.svg)



## Humdrum + R 

Humdrum$\mathbb{R}$ is a modern alternative to the original humdrum toolkit.

+ Humdrum syntax $\leftrightarrow$ R "tidy" data.table ecosystem
+ Tools for general information processing 
  + (tabulation, n-grams, information theory, pattern finding)
+ Tools for musical processing 
  + (transposition, metric position, scale degree)
+ Access to any/all R libraries!


## Humdrum + R | Goals

+ Flexible/general
  + Not just "scores"
  + In particular, system for non-Western music
+ Transparent
  + Not a black box
  + Facilitate (and encourage) thoughtful analysis
    + Make you think about what you are doing


# Representing Music

<!-- Music notation is a complex language. Like a natural language, it is always changing, it is at times ambiguous and/or redundant, and can be used in many different ways by different people for different purposes. Because of these qualities, it is impossible to create a perfect software for music notation. -->
<!-- 			-- Eleanor Selfridge-Field (2014) -->


## Music as Data

A music encoding is a representation of musical events (notes, chords) or structures (meter, tonality).

+ No encoding is perfect.
  + Encodings are at best imperfect measurements of "real" structures.
+ There are many ways we can represent musical information.
  + Different approaches reveal different information.

----

Today we'll use humdrum$_{\mathbb{R}}$ to explore and discuss basic questions about pitch data.

+ I'll draw on three datasets:
  + The 371 Bach chorales
  + The CoCoPops corpus of rock/pop vocal transcriptions
  + The Saraga dataset of Hindustani performances.
